# ACE production release status

Checked on 6 October 2026. Step 1.1 merged into `master` as
`d27b9df77e4416dc2cd472abf59dc2a6568b7b2a`. The earlier [production deployment](https://github.com/FSS-Ltd/pathway/actions/runs/34189600516)
failed during Prisma migration; the API, admin and web deploy jobs were skipped.
The last successful deployment was
[`ea7c44c6edd043889f90e62935bf851505ebb5df`](https://github.com/FSS-Ltd/pathway/actions/runs/31965820501).

The product owner has directed us to continue implementation while Supabase is
unavailable, then run migrations and resolve database issues at the end. The
production workflow therefore requires manual dispatch; merging to `master`
does not start migrations or app deployment. No production migration or
deployment is claimed by this record.

Step 1.1 makes production deployment explicit and accepts only the configured
Supabase project's direct database endpoint or shared session pooler on port
5432 for migrations. It rejects a transaction pooler URL, missing credentials
and a project mismatch before Prisma starts.
The production credentials, connection and schema status still need verification
when Supabase is available. Later steps start only after the preceding PR has
passing CI on its current revision and is merged into `master`.

Local step 1.1 verification: migration URL tests 7/7; database deploy workflow
tests 6/6; lint and typecheck 16/16 packages each; Prettier and
`git diff --check` passed. `graphify update .` rebuilt the code graph. The
database connection, migration status and production smoke journeys remain
unverified while Supabase is unavailable. No app build was run because this
step changes the release workflow and CLI scripts, not app code.

Step 1.2a introduces the grant record, validity and revocation fields, and
organisation or site scoped RLS. It does not enable any tag or change effective
permissions. The catalogue, delegation checks, APIs and custom-role migration
remain for later delivery steps. Its migration is committed for later staging
and production application; no live Supabase migration is being attempted now.

Step 1.2b records the product-owner decision to retire customer-created roles
across all sectors. Its typed catalogue matches all 17 Oasis tag names. Five
currently map to delegable NexSteps permissions; twelve remain unavailable
until their missing permission, module, or record-scope rules are delivered.
The catalogue alone does not grant access. Grant/revoke and effective-access
APIs merged in step 1.2c but have not been deployed.

Step 1.2c local verification: API unit tests 994/994, API integration tests
357/357 against disposable Postgres, repository lint and typecheck 16/16 each,
API build, strict local RLS gate, new-file Prettier check, `git diff --check`,
and `graphify update .` passed. The RLS gate used the repository's documented
public-table exposure acceptance; the three pre-existing tables it reports
remain a separate production concern. Live Supabase migration and production
smoke tests remain deferred under the product owner's instruction.

Step 1.2d1 removes customer-facing role creation, editing, cloning,
permission replacement, and retirement from the shared admin application.
The corresponding API routes return a request-correlated `410` after the
existing authentication and permission guards. Historical role definitions
and assignments remain readable. Assigning only fixed roles, auditing parity
and retiring legacy assignments belong to steps 1.2d2 and 1.2d3. The
database's dedicated system-role seed identity remains mandatory in
production. Disposable integration fixtures may temporarily disable the
template trigger in a transaction and restore it before the fixture is used.
Local verification: repository lint and typecheck 16/16 each; API unit
tests, admin tests, API and admin builds, and 20 focused API integration
tests passed. The admin build used a non-secret mock API mode and test Clerk
publishable key. The full local integration suite had 43 passing and 11
failing suites because the disposable test database login has superuser/RLS
bypass privileges and retained conflicting fixtures; current-revision CI
must provide the clean full-suite result. `graphify update .`, targeted
Prettier checks, and `git diff --check` passed. CI then passed all five jobs
on the final PR revision and the host confirmed the merge.

Step 1.2d2 makes the assignment service select only active, platform-owned
fixed roles for new grants. The shared admin assignment picker shows only
those roles. Historical custom assignments remain visible and revocable so
step 1.2d3 can compare and retire them without widening user access.
Local lint and typecheck passed 16/16 packages, API unit tests passed
130/130 suites (998 tests), admin tests passed, and API/admin builds passed.
The two affected database integration suites passed 12/12 tests after a
disposable local database reset. The full local integration run passed 54/54
suites (359/359 tests) when configured with the dedicated RLS roles used by
CI. `graphify update .`, targeted Prettier checks, and `git diff --check`
passed. All five CI jobs then passed on the final PR revision, and GitHub
confirmed the merge.

Step 1.2d3a inventories currently valid custom-role assignments for one
organisation through read-only, organisation-scoped pages. It reports raw
permission keys and conservative fixed-role/tag candidates without issuing
or revoking grants. Live source data, effective-access parity, and audited
retirement remain for step 1.2d3b when the database is available.
Local verification: repository lint and typecheck passed 16/16 packages;
API unit tests passed 131/131 suites (1001 tests); the API build and targeted
formatting passed. A populated disposable Postgres smoke run reported a
custom assignment and candidate tag, then the fixture was removed and its
absence verified. The script also rejects an invalid organisation ID before
opening a database connection. No production inventory was run.

## Release gate

After implementation, restore the Supabase connection; inspect migration status
and pending SQL; apply and test migrations in staging; then deploy the verified
`master` commit. Record the migration and app job IDs, smoke-test the API,
authenticated admin and public configurator, and check production errors before
marking the release complete.
